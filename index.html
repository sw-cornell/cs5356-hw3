                    Hi there! My name is Siyan Wang (王思岩), and I'm a master's student at Cornell Tech, focusing on Information Systems with a Connective Media concentration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before joining Cornell Tech, I worked as a data and product professional in Silicon Valley and as a bilingual freelance writer, covering topics in technology, sports, and media. I hold a B.S. in Mathematics from Haverford College, where I graduated in 2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of academics and work, I enjoy performing stand-up comedy, hosting my women's sports podcast, commenting on soccer games, playing tennis, and immersing myself in musicals.
                </p>
